# Updated Portfolio
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)


## Description
An updated portfolio is necessary in a developer's job search. This portfolio has been updated to include the latest group project, along with 2 other assignments, an updated resume, and links to the GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. Instead of showing the profile, projects, and contact information all on one page, like the previous portfolios, I created separate pages for the projects and contact info to create a more user-friendly and aesthetic view.

## Technologies
This portfolio was created with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
